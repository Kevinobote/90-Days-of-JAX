# Day 010: Combining All JAX Transformations and Next Steps

## Goal
- Review and demonstrate the synergistic power of combining `jax.jit`, `jax.grad`, and `jax.vmap`.
- Understand how these transformations are typically composed in practical JAX code, especially for machine learning.
- Outline key next steps and advanced topics in your JAX learning journey.

## Key Learnings
- **Compositionality is Power:** JAX's strength lies in its ability to compose its transformations. You can `jit` a `grad`ient, `vmap` a `jit`-compiled function, or `grad` a `vmap`ped function. This allows for highly optimized and flexible numerical programs.
- **Common Combinations:**
    - **`jax.jit(jax.grad(func))`**: The most common pattern for machine learning, compiling the entire backpropagation graph for a loss function. This provides significant speedups during training.
    - **`jax.jit(jax.vmap(func, ...))`**: Efficiently applying a function over batches of data with JIT compilation. This replaces slow Python loops with fast, compiled XLA code.
    - **`jax.grad(jax.vmap(func, ...))` followed by `jax.jit(...)`**: Used when you need to compute gradients that involve batching. For instance, computing the gradient of a *total batch loss* where the individual example losses were calculated using `vmap`. This requires careful thought about `in_axes` and summing the loss to a scalar.
- **Functional Programming Paradigm:** JAX encourages a functional style. Functions are pure, state is explicit (e.g., PRNG keys, model parameters passed as arguments), and transformations operate on these pure functions.
- **The PyTree Concept:** Crucial for handling nested data structures like model parameters. `jax.tree.map`, `jax.tree.leaves`, etc., are indispensable for working with PyTrees.
- **Beyond the Basics:** The challenge concludes by highlighting essential next steps:
    - **State Management Libraries:** Flax, Equinox, Haiku are frameworks built on JAX that help manage complex model parameters and state more easily.
    - **Custom Gradients:** For fine-grained control over AD.
    - **JAX Control Flow Primitives (`jax.lax`):** For writing JIT-compatible loops and conditionals that are compiled into the XLA graph.
    - **Multi-Device Parallelism (`jax.pmap`):** Scaling computations across multiple GPUs/TPUs.
    - **Debugging Tools:** Techniques for inspecting values within compiled functions.

## Code Explanation (`main.py`)
- **Part 1 (`jit(grad(func))`):** Demonstrates the common pattern of JIT-compiling a gradient calculation for a simple scalar function.
- **Part 2 (`jit(vmap(func))`):** Shows the efficiency of applying a JIT-compiled vmapped function over large batches.
- **Part 3 (`jit(grad(vmap(func)))`):** A more advanced example demonstrating how to compose `grad` and `vmap` to compute gradients for a batched loss function, a common scenario in ML.
- **Part 4 (Simplified Training Loop):** Revisits the neural network training from Day 8, emphasizing how all these transformations (`jit`, `grad`, `vmap` - implicitly in `batched_forward_pass`) come together in a practical setting.
- **Part 5 (Next Steps):** A summary of key advanced topics to explore after completing this foundational challenge.
