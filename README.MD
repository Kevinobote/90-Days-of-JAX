# ðŸš€ JAX 90-Day Learning Challenge ðŸš€

Welcome to my JAX 90-Day Learning Challenge repository! This repository documents my journey of learning JAX, Google's high-performance numerical computing library, focusing on its core concepts, advanced transformations, and applications in machine learning.

The goal of this challenge is to build a solid foundation in JAX through consistent daily practice, hands-on coding, and pushing progress to GitHub.

## ðŸŽ¯ Challenge Goals

* **Master JAX Fundamentals:** Gain a deep understanding of JAX arrays, `jax.jit` for compilation, and `jax.grad` for automatic differentiation.
* **Explore Advanced Transformations:** Learn how to effectively use `jax.vmap` for vectorization and understand the principles of `jax.pmap` for parallelization.
* **Apply JAX to Machine Learning:** Implement neural networks from scratch and utilize key libraries within the JAX ecosystem (like Equinox, Flax, and Optax).
* **Build a Portfolio:** Create practical, working examples and small projects to showcase my JAX skills.
* **Consistent Practice:** Commit code and documentation daily (or almost daily) for 90 days.

## ðŸ“… Roadmap Overview

This challenge is structured into three main phases:

1.  **Phase 1: Foundations & Core JAX (Days 1-30)**
    * Focus: Installation, JAX vs. NumPy, `jax.jit`, `jax.grad`, PRNG keys, basic linear/logistic regression.
    * Goal: Solid grasp of JAX's fundamental mechanics.

2.  **Phase 2: Advanced JAX & First Project (Days 31-60)**
    * Focus: `jax.vmap`, introduction to `jax.pmap`, building a simple Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) from scratch.
    * Goal: Ability to vectorize computations and build a basic neural network in pure JAX.

3.  **Phase 3: JAX Ecosystem & Deeper Dive (Days 61-90)**
    * Focus: Exploring libraries like Equinox, Flax, and Optax; tackling more complex ML models or scientific computing problems.
    * Goal: Proficiency in using the broader JAX ecosystem and completing a more substantial final project.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

Each day's progress is typically documented in its own dedicated folder, containing the relevant Python script(s) and a `README.md` file detailing the day's learnings, code explanation, and any challenges faced.
